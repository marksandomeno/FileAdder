                                        Writing to locally stored files from a java program.

Instructions:

1) Open Terminal and type in:

        java -jar (JAR FILE)
        
2) Upon running Jar file the following instructions should appear:

ENTER A VALID PATH TO A .TXT FILE
Example: /Users/marksandomeno/Desktop/MAIN_FILE.txt
You can find a specific file location by dragging it into the Terminal
_______________________________________________________________________
Enter File Path (No Spaces) ->    


3) Enter path to locally stored file, or drag the file into the terminal to do it automatically. It should look something like this:

    Enter File Path (No Spaces) ->   /Users/marksandomeno/Desktop/MAIN_FILE.txt
    
    
 4) Once you click enter you should get something like this:
 
  Fetching File Data...
  Enter text you wish to import into file:
  
  
 5) Enter the text you wish to add to the file
 
 6) ____COMPLETE____
